# Tutorials

A place for us to post tutorials to help each other with code-related things.

Unless otherwise specified, the files in this repository are licensed under the

## Adding a tutorial

No need to submit a pull request if you're adding your own tutorial&mdash;just go
  ahead and push it to the repository. Please include it in an appropriate folder
  (you can make a new folder if an appropriate one does not exist yet).

Please add your name/copyright info so that proper credit can be attributed to you
  if someone else finds the tutorial helpful and wants to share it! (Alternatively,
  you are welcome to license it differently.)

## Editing a tutorial/contributing to an existing tutorial

If you are the author or one of the primary authors of the tutorial, you can go
  ahead and push any updates.

If it is someone else's tutorial and you would like to suggest a change, please
  do so using a pull request.
